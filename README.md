This folder stores the test data and results for my [Monocular Visual Odometry project](https://github.com/felixchenfy/Monocular-Visual-Odometry).

Images in [dataset_images_matlab/](dataset_images_matlab/) are from [New Tsukuba Stereo Database](http://cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/). I only put its first 150 images here, so that you can test my program. (Please contact me if you feel this violates the copy right.) Images in this dataset are symthetic, so they have abundant and good quality feature points, which makes the VO easier to work.

Some test images are stored in [test_data/](test_data/). They are from [TUM dataset](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download).

Some other images, gif, video are the result of my visual odometry.
